## Setup and run

To setup the project locally follow the instructions:

#### Fork

Firstly you have to create your own copy of the project on GitHub. You can do this by clicking the Fork button that can be found on the top right corner of the 
[landing page](https://github.com/Amulya-coder/React-airbnb.github.io) of the repository.

#### Clone

_**Note**_: _For this you need to install git on your machine. You can download the git tool from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)._

- If you have forked the project, run the following command -

  `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME/anitab-org.github.io`

  where `YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME` is your GitHub handle.

- If you haven't forked the project, run the following command -

  `git clone https://github.com/Amulya-coder/React-airbnb.github.io`

- Now after you cloned the repository, get into the React-airbnb.github.io directory by -

  `cd React-airbnb`
  
 Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

npm start or yarn start
Runs the app in development mode.
